| RustSec Advisory Database |    https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db/    | The RustSec Advisory Database is a repository of security advisories filed against Rust crates published via https://crates.io. Works closely with Cargo Audit. |
|  RustSec Advisory Client  |    https://github.com/RustSec/rustsec-crate   | Client library for accessing the RustSec Security Advisory Database: fetches the advisory-db (or other compatible) git repository and audits Cargo.lock files against it. It is mainly used by   Cargo Audit but may be useful if you would like to consume the RustSec advisory database in other capacities. |
|        Cargo Audit        |     https://github.com/RustSec/cargo-audit    | Audit Cargo.lock for crates with security vulnerabilities reported to the RustSec Advisory Database. |
